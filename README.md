# Redirect
For a quick start, you need to create a Telegram Bot. Then you need to send any message to it (/start does not count).

Then in the script.js file instead of ```YOUR_BOT_API``` we must insert the API of our bot. I want to point out that we should insert exactly instead of it. Also do and with ```YOUR_CHAT_ID```, we must enter the ID of your chat with the bot.

After all the actions can somewhere want our static site and that's it.
